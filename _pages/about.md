Greetings! I am currently a Postdoc at the Institute of Data Science, [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. See-Kiong Ng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_wsommYAAAAJ). Before that, I received my PhD degree at [Fuzhou University](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Wenzhong Guo](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/4993.htm) and [Prof. Shiping Wang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1202/8958.htm). From Oct 2021 to Oct 2022, I am a visiting student in the School of Data Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), China, supervised by [Prof. Jicong Fan](https://jicongfan.github.io/). From Jan 2023 to June 2023, I am a visiting student in the Cooperative AI Lab, King's College London, UK, supervised by [Prof. Yali Du](https://yalidu.github.io/). My research interests include anomaly detection, deep clustering, graph neural networks, and generative models. My studies have led to over 20 scientific publications <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g9TVoA0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fjinyucai95%2Fjinyucai95.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> on top-tier conferences and journals, including ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM MM, IEEE TMM, PR, etc.
